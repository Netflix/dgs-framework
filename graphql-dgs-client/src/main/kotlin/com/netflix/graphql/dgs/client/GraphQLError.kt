/**
The value of the errorType field is an enumeration of error types.
An errorType is a fairly coarse characterization of an error that should be sufficient for client side branching logic.
The enumeration of error types should remain mostly static.
More specific errors may be specified by the errorDetail field.

Http mappings are provided only as documentation.
These are rough mappings intended to provide a quick explanation of the semantics by analogy with HTTP.

     an error space that is not known in this address space.  Also
     errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information
     may be converted to this error.

     Service implementers can use the following guidelines to decide
     between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `UNAVAILABLE`:

     - Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call.
     - Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until
     the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
     fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
     should be returned since the client should not retry unless
     the files are deleted from the directory.
