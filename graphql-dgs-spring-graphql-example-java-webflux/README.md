This example app demonstrates some DGS framework features.
It also includes a very simple React UI that uses Apollo Client that connects to both the /graphql and /subscriptions endpoints.
Start the app by running the `ExampleApp` class (e.g. from an IDE).

* Graphiql will be available on: http://localhost:8080/graphiql
* The example UI will be available on: http://localhost:8080/index.html

The example project includes a number of tests as well.
