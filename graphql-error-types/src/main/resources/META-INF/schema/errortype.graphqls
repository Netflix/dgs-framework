    """
    Unknown error.

    For example, this error may be returned when
    an error code received from another address space belongs to
    an error space that is not known in this address space.  Also
    errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information
    may be converted to this error.

    If a client sees an unknown errorType, it will be interpreted as UNKNOWN.
    Unknown errors MUST NOT trigger any special behavior. These MAY be treated
    by an implementation as being equivalent to INTERNAL.

    When possible, a more specific error should be provided.

    Internal error.

    An unexpected internal error was encountered. This means that some
    invariants expected by the underlying system have been broken.

    The requested entity was not found.

    This could apply to a resource that has never existed (e.g. bad resource id),
    or a resource that no longer exists (e.g. cache expired.)

    Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class
    of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented allowlist,
    `NOT_FOUND` may be used. If a request is denied for some users within
    a class of users, such as user-based access control, `PERMISSION_DENIED`
    must be used.

    The caller does not have permission to execute the specified

    `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for rejections
    caused by exhausting some resource or quota.
    `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used if the caller
    cannot be identified (use `UNAUTHENTICATED`

    other pre-conditions.

    Bad Request.

    There is a problem with the request.

    Currently Unavailable.

    The service is currently unavailable.  This is most likely a
    transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with
    a backoff.

    HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable
    """
    UNAVAILABLE

    """
    The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
    required for the operation's execution.  For example, the directory
    to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to
    a non-directory, etc.

    Service implementers can use the following guidelines to decide
    between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `UNAVAILABLE`:

    - Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call.
    - Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until
    the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
         fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
    should be returned since the client should not retry unless
    the files are deleted from the directory.
